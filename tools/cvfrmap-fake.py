cvfr-bridge / fake (dev simulator).

A schema-driven dev backend that serves the cvfr-bridge JSON shape on
the same port as the real backends, using a synthetic in-flight
aircraft. Use it to develop, tweak, and demo the cvfr-map web UI when
X-Plane (and the real Python/C bridges) aren't available -- or to feed
NavAid's own "Connect to simulator" (it polls this exact port/shape
too), for testing in-flight features without a real flight or X-Plane.

Like python/cvfrmap-bridge.py, this script reads ../schema.json at
startup as the single source of truth: port, endpoint, field order,
and per-field fallback values all come from there. Adding a field to
schema.json automatically adds it to the fake's output (with its
schema fallback) without a code change here.

Two flight modes, chosen by --route:

  Default (no --route): a synthetic figure-8 over the schema fallback --
  a right loop (CW, banked right) joined to a left loop (CCW, banked
  left), both passing through the schema's lat/lon. Each half-loop is
  a rate-1 turn (3 deg/s, 120 s per loop, 240 s per full eight).
  Longitude is corrected by cos(lat0) so the loops look visually round
  on the map at LLBG's latitude. Heading comes from the analytical
  velocity vector along the trajectory (continuous across the crossing
  point). Roll flips +-15 deg at each loop boundary (bank reversal at
  the crossing point, instantaneous -- we don't model the brief
  wings-level moment). Altitude steady at 2500 ft, vsi 0, pitch 0,
  ias a steady 90 kt.

  --route PATH: flies an actual planned route instead -- a JSON export
  from NavAid (docs/app/io.js's serializeRoute(): {waypoints, legs}).
  Each leg is flown as a straight great-circle track at its own
  planned altitude (legs[i].inboundAltitude) and speed
  (legs[i].flightSpeed), heading constant per leg (the leg's own
  bearing), altitude/IAS stepping at each waypoint (no climb/descent
  modeled -- same "steady, not smoothed" simplicity the figure-8 mode
  already has). Once the last waypoint is reached, loops back to the
  first so a dev server keeps running indefinitely across repeated
  test flights. Position is the standard intermediate-point-on-a-
  great-circle interpolation (not linear lat/lng, which drifts off
  the actual track on a longer leg) using the same formulas and Earth
  radius (3440.065 nm) NavAid's own geo() uses, so distances/times
  between the two agree.

  Both modes: sim_ready is always true (this is a fake sim -- it's
  always live).

--wind-dir DEG --wind-speed KT (route mode only): a constant surface wind,
reported in wind_dir/wind_speed AND actually flown -- heading stays the
leg's own planned bearing (a non-correcting pilot's compass reading), while
position follows the RESULTANT ground track that heading produces through
the wind, drifting off the plotted line whenever there's a crosswind
component. That's deliberate: it gives NavAid's own drift-off-course alert
a genuinely drifting aircraft to detect, which an on-track/wind-corrected
position never would. See resultant_track()'s docstring for the exact
distinction from a wind-CORRECTION calculation.

--speed-factor N scales the simulated clock (5 = fly 5x faster than real
time) without changing how often a client polls -- covers a route, or
waits out the drift alert's 2-minute check, much sooner.

Stdlib only, no X-Plane required. Not a real backend - intentionally
NOT listed in the README's "two backends, same wire format" table.
